#chippi 

🐚 chippi(ചിപ്പി) is Malayalam for shell.

As the name suggests, this project is a hobby attempt to build a lightweight, minimal, and fun command-line shell in C. (primarily to study C, do give feedback if you feel like i could have made a better code somewhere)


## Current Status 
- support single line input only
- no execution
- a fun simple chippi greeting feature (run with `hello` command)
- support exit on pressing `Ctrl+D` or typing `exit` in user input

## Testing Out
